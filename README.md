# zippyserver.github.io
This is the backend for the claimzippy project assignment
.
The code for backend is present in the MASTER branch
.
This assignment was very challenging but still i took it.
I was assigned with the fullstack development of the web assignment. 
Yet i managed only to develop the backend and deploy it.
.
CRUD operations are operative for the node.js code.
.
I give my honest apologies for not submitting the frontend
. 
I hope you notice my effort on the backend and consider my hardwork.
.
Challenges faced:
. I did not use app = use(express.json()) and did not notice is for 12 hours while trying to find what was the mistake.
. After noticing the above mistake , the next challenging one was the deployment part.
. Since i did not attend for the guidance meeting , i faced so much difficulty in deploying the node.js
. Finally i got to deploy the node.js through cyclic


Local Deployment Guide:
. run : npm run dev
It is equivalent to npm nodemon app.js
It will start the server at https://localhost:5000/
Which means the server runs at localhost port 5000

Deployment over Internet:
. The hosting and deployment was made with app.cyclic.sh
. The website url for accessing the api GET call is https://happy-peplum-elk.cyclic.app/

Git repository LInk:
. https://github.com/sundar3942/zippyserver.github.io.git
